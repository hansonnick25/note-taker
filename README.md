# Note Taker

## Description

This Note Taking App will take input and store it in json format. The user can then view the notes they have taken and delete them if they wish. This app uses express.js to handle the server and routing. The front end is handled by html and css. The back end is handled by javascript and node.js.

I was provided starter code that included the website styling and scripting. I was tasked with creating the server and routing for the website. I used express.js to handle the server and routing. I also used node.js to handle the back end of the website. I used fs to read and write to the json file that stores the notes. I used uuid to create unique ids for each note. I used the starter code to create the html and css for the website.
